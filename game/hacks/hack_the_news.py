        The Navy has internal connections at these companies who have all agreed to mark news about the accident as "censored" or "fake news"

        We have to disable these labels from our content
        Choose which social media do you want to prioritize:
            Twidda
            Instashare
            Tumbly
            WeTube
            FaceBud




        We need to protect our people on social media too, remember #Gamergate? well there are certain people on the
        internet who aren't so happy we are exposing the Navy's cover up, and some of our people are going to be
        targeted for online harrassment.
        Can you help make some hacks to protect them.

        Option 1:
            detect a DDOS <-- that could be the root_virus attack!

            Massive numbers of queries coming in all at once will overload our accounts and lock us out.
            Too much traffic coming into our websites will shut them down.

        Option 2:
            Implement two-factor authentication
