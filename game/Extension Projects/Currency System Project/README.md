## Brainstorm
The overarching goal of this project is to build a currency system that will help players in their fight for social justice.
Spend 30 minutes brainstorming how you can acheive this goal. Here are some guiding questions to help with this procces:

 Think about how you can implement a currency system  in a way that would further advance the social justice /anti-colonialism aspect of the game? Think about what the currency can be used to buy/get and how that can aid the players.

## Instructions
Using global variables and object oriented programming create a currency system where players will be rewarded everytime they 
complete a hack in the game with currency points they can use later in the game. You will build upon the existing code and create
a variable that tracks the points earned after each hack. You can also incorporate the stand your ground points into the currency sytem as well.
We encourae you to use new libraries and coding skills for this project. We also encourage you to use good coding practices 
such as commenting to explain your code to others and creating different files for different tasks After you finish the project you will present to your 
classmates how your implementation furthers the social justice aspect of the game.
